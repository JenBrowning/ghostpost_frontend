Baby Got Back
Sir Mix-a-Lot
Oh my God, Becky
Look at her butt
It is so big

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes me so horny
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on

So Fellas
Fellas
Has your girlfriend got butt
Tell her to shake it, shake it,
Shake that healthy butt

Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back

LA face with Oakland booty
LA face with Oakland booty
LA face with Oakland booty

So ladies
Ladies
If you wanna role in my Mercedes
Then turn around
Stick it out
Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back

Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back

Baby got back back back
